My implementation of a linked wordcloud using python and PHP

Problem Description:
-> read test.txt and noise.txt.
-> remove words contained in test using noise (filtering the noise words from test).
-> Calculate range and unique words.
-> Depending on frequency generate a wordcloud by writing it to HTML.
-> Make the words linked, ie when clicked shows the lines where it appears.
